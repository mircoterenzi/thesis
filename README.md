# Neverlang for modelling Domain-Specific Languages
The study focuses on the reusability of code and provides an in-depth examination of the Neverlang language workbench. The Neverlang framework encourages this approach through feature-oriented modelling. It 
facilitates the development of domain-specific languages (DSLs), thereby reducing the abstraction gap and the cognitive load required to learn them.

The primary objective of the project has been to examine existing DSLs and to identify methods for the efficient and agile implementation of clones using Neverlang. In particular, a structured query language (SQL) 
clone has been proposed to replicate the main feature of the original language.

This repository contains a comprehensive and detailed account of the work, presented in Italian. I want to express my sincerest gratitude to Professors Viroli Mirko and Aguzzi Gianluca for their invaluable guidance 
and support throughout the thesis process.
